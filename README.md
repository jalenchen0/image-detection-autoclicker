# Image Detection Autoclicker

This script detects a specific image on a portion of the screen. On detection, it autoclicks at the current mouse position until the image is no longer detected.

The following settings are available to change at the top of the script:
- Name of the image to detect
- Size of the detection box (width and height)
- Minimum confidence percentage for a match
- Turn on or off the preview preview window

Make sure to place the images you want to detect in the images folder.

This script uses OpenCV for image detection.
